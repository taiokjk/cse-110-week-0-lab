# Greeting net traveller!

Oops, my appologize. That was a little too loud for comfort. Let's try again. *In Italic!*

*Greeting net traveller.* Welcome to my space, heh heh. My name is Liam and I made this webpage solely for the purpose of passing CSE 110 *finger crossed*. Sooooo, here is a bunch of markdown styles to satisfy the requirements:

# About me

A little about myself? *Nobody asked*. I am a full-stack web developer with experience in ~~many~~ programming languages. To me languages don't matter, but good attitude! I've involved in many projects in both small and big companies, with a wide range of products demands. I've done email handling, core settings, system log, upload/download from server, encoding/decoding data, microservice architechture, messaging system, and most importantly, **bug fixing**. I also have experience in making IoT devices, 3D printing, a little bit of game development as well as making 3D models. Coding aside, I like dancing, listening to music (mostly R&B and sometimes pop), and gaming (New World!).

Enough about me. How about you? Let's get to know each other. Text me `669-699-8094` or email me at lnguyen@ucsd.edu

That is all. Have a nice morning/afternoon/evening/night net traveller!
